Overview
This project is a simple Password Strength Checker implemented in Python. It evaluates the strength of a given password based on common security criteria, helping users create strong and secure passwords to protect their accounts and data.

Features
Checks password length (minimum recommended length)

Detects the use of uppercase and lowercase letters

Validates the inclusion of digits

Checks for special characters (symbols)

Provides a strength rating (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong)

Gives suggestions to improve password security

How It Works
The script analyzes the password against multiple rules:

Length: Ensures password meets a minimum length requirement (e.g., 8 characters)

Character Variety: Ensures inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols

Common Patterns: Optionally checks against common weak patterns or dictionary words (if implemented)

Based on these checks, it calculates a score and classifies the password strength accordingly.

Installation
Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
